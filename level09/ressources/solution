We can see that the binary encrypt the string in parameter with +n ascci value for each lenght of the string.

$> cat token

We understand that the string in tokken has been hashed with the binary so we need
to reverse it.

To see value of non printable characters we use hexdump -C token
Now that we have hex value of each characters of the token string we just need
to increment them.

The result is f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq.
