When we reverse the binary we can see a call to ptrace that block the flow of the program. We just have to set a breakpoint before it and jump after it returns.
We can also see that the program compare uid value for each flag.
If we modify the eax value after the getuid call with 3014 (uid of flqg14) the prgram will puts the flag.

(gdb) b main
(gdb) b * 0x08048982
(gdb) c
(gdb) b * 0x080489a8
(gdb) jump * 0x080489a8
(gdb) b * 0x08048b02
(gdb) c
(gdb) set $eax=3014
(gdb) c
